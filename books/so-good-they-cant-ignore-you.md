BLUF
----
"So Good They Can't Ignore You" is a very good book that introduces several mental models which have changed how I think about careers, value propositions, and skill acquisition. It's well-written and generally tightly-argued, in a direct, pragmatic, and enjoyable style. It has a few minor warts, but nothing to prevent me from enthusiastically recommending it to those interested in optimizing their job satisfaction.


Commendations & Criticisms
--------------------------
### Commendations
* Clear and pragmatic
* Entertaining
* Generally tightly-argued
* Checks out with my experiences
* Good length
* Reshaped my understanding of career satisfaction
* Like Taleb's "Fooled by Randomness", "So Good They Can't Ignore You" attacks overreaching, immediate-gratification claims to argue for tighter restrictions on what's possible
    * I.e. "get a great job you love overnight with no experience" just isn't possible; a great job requires hard work & dedication
    * Also aligns with what I've experienced firsthand - nothing worth having comes for free
* Conclusion tying up the introduction was a satisfying touch

### Criticisms
* What's being left out? Are there areas where focusing on career capital wasn't successful?
* Rarely, some poor logic: 
    * E.g. "to see this, we can turn to anecdote", then hedging with "of course this isn't a great example" knowing that the reader would be emotionally convinced by the anecdote
    * E.g. the Wrzniewski study only had n=196 at two work sites, and a much-narrower n=24 research assistants - not enough to draw generalized conclusions from
* Newport wrote this book before he even started at Georgetown. How does he know the strategies he proposes to replace the craftsman mindset even apply in his own life? 
    * They seem intuitively true... but are they really?
* "Control" and "mission" seemed like two arbitrary things Newport realized you could purchase with career capital and subsequently promoted to full segments. Are they the only things? If not, what are the others?
* The attributes of a great mission aren't explicitly detailed
* The "Rules" terminology was confusing because they weren't really rules - more like concepts
    * Newport likes his numbered titles (Rules 1-4, Control Traps 1 & 2), but these are harder to remember (e.g. compare "type 1 & type 2 errors" with "false positive & false negative")
* Where does "mission" fit into Self Determination Theory which posits that "autonomy", "competence", and "relatedness" are necessary for a great job?

Detailed Synthesis
------------------
### How NOT to get a great job
* Modern-day advice says:
    * You need "a job you're passionate about" to find job satisfaction (this is the **passion mindset**)
    * Many people aren't happy with their careers because they don't have the courage to pursue their passion (**courage culture**)
* Steve Jobs is often held up as an example of "chase your passion"
* Newport claims passion mindset & courage culture are bullshit:
    * Points out the realities of Steve Jobs - Jobs was a hippy with little interest in computers until it could make him money
    * Nobody really starts out trying to change the world; they just get really good at stuff and end up in a position to do it
    * Passion mindset considered harmful: NOT feeling passionate about your job can lead to self-inflicted angst and dissatisfaction with your current job

### What makes a great job?
* [Self-determination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory) posits three "nutriments" necessary for a great job:
    1. Autonomy - control over your day
    2. Competence - being good at what you do
    3. Relatedness - connection to other people
* SDT posits that whether a job aligns with your passion DOESN'T matter; rather, people are passionate about what they're good at!
    * E.g. [Amy Wrzesniewski’s study](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/amywrzesniewski/documents/Jobscareersandcallings.pdf), where years of experience at the job positively correlated with job satisfaction
        * Should be stressed that the stats here really weren't good (only n=24 from two work sites); difficult to draw any actual conclusions 
    * E.g. in my own life - I wanted to design video games and did computer science in university because it seemed like the closest thing, even though databases and functions and algorithms seemed boring as sin. Lo and behold, as I got good at it I started to love it.

### How to actually get a great job?
* Great jobs are rare and, therefore, valuable
* To get a great job, you need to have something rare & valuable to offer in return
* **Career capital** is the rare and valuable skills you trade for the attributes that make a great job
* To get a great job, embrace the **craftsman mindset** - focus on building rare and valuable skills
    * In the words of Steve Martin, be "so good they can't ignore you"
    * Studio musicians have a saying, "The tape doesn't lie"
        * I.e., your skill is on plain display when you're recorded
    * This requires [Extreme Ownership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership) - owning that you suck because _you haven't put in the work_ and then pushing through the pain to get better!
* The passion mindset is analogous to surrendering control and embracing victimhood and what-will-the-world-offer-me mentality: "I'm not happy with my job because I'm not passionate about my job" (i.e., a job hasn't landed in my lap that I like)
* The craftsman mindset is all about Extreme Ownership and what-will-I-offer-the-world mentality: "I'm not happy with my job because I haven't grinded to level up the skills that would allow me to be happy"
    * Entry-level positions are GOING to suck! Great jobs are rare and valuable, and you have to put in your time!
    * E.g. [studio owner Bart Koster re. Trent Reznor, where Reznor used to work as a handyman: "He was so focused in everything he did. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great."](http://nothing.nin.net/int12.html)
    * Newport: "there’s something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centered concerns about whether your job is 'just right,' and instead put your head down and plug away at getting really damn good. No one owes you a great career, it argues; you need to earn it—and the process won’t be easy."
* Jocko says, "there are two types of leaders: effective and ineffective. If you're not effective, you're ineffective". Newport asserts the same thing:
    * The bullshit passion mindset says, 'is this truly my passion?', and how can anyone answer that? 
    * The craftsman mindset says, 'Am I effective/noticed or ineffective/ignored?', and that's easy to answer

### Words of warning about the grind
* There are a few exceptions where 'shut up and grind' isn't the right answer:
    1. The job doesn't build valuable skills
    2. The work is useless or harmful
    3. You're forced to work with people you hate
* Grinding in this case isn't helpful because you won't be earning any career capital or you won't be able to stick with it long enough to do so

### On skills
* Popular wisdom asserts "The 10,000-Hour Rule" - it takes 10,000 hours to become a master at something
* But, not all practice hours are created equal! Effectively building career capital requires **deliberate practice** - constantly pushing yourself just beyond your comfort zone with immediate & honest feedback
    * "The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that’s the hardest phase" ~ Ira Glass
    * "Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable."
    * E.g. what separate intermediate chess players from grandmasters is the amount of time they spend in deliberate practice: a study on chess players found that time spent in deliberate study of games, using a teacher for feedback, was FAR superior to competition play in skill acquisition (Charness, 2005)
    * E.g. Jordan Tice, the virtuoso bluegrass musician who always pushes himself to go just a little faster whenever he feels comfortable
* Easy to get caught in a "good-enough plateau" - you're good enough at a thing and you stop pushing your boundaries
    * Particularly relevant in software engineering, where tech requires effort just to stay abreast of
* Ira Glass quote: "I feel like your problem is that you’re trying to judge all things in the abstract before you do them. That’s your tragic mistake."
    * Basically, you need to get out there and DO!
    * This directly touches on the reflect-synthesize-act cycle: the majority of your time should be out there acting/grinding, gathering material for your reflection
* The reward: "Let’s assume you’re a knowledge worker, which is a field without a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value"

### Directing Your Skill Development
1. Identify you career capital market
    * Two types of career capital markets: winner-take-all and auction
        * **Winner-take-all** markets have only one metric you're judged by, and it's clear how to become better (e.g. develop your skill in music, or your writing skill, or your ability to execute on projects)
        * **Auction** markets have multiple paths to success (e.g. CEO)
    * Beware of mistaking winner-take-all markets for auction markets (e.g. blogging)
2. Identify the career capital
    * Winner-take-all is obvious
    * In the "auction" market, best thing you can do is take advantage of already-open opportunities to gain as much varied experience as you can
3. Identify what "good" looks
    * Set goals!
    * If I don't have a direction, I won't have a target for my deliberate practice
4. Deliberate practice WITH FEEDBACK!
5. Wait!
    * It's easy to get distracted
    * Steve Martin defines diligence as the ability to ignore unrelated pursuits
    * From [an article on Newport's blog](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/01/29/closing-your-interests-opens-more-interesting-opportunities-the-power-of-diligence-in-creating-a-remarkable-life/): "If you collapse Martin’s skills into a flat list, he sounds like a Renaissance man, but if you take a snapshot of any particular point of his life, you’ll encounter relentless, longterm focus on a very small number of things."
    * In [procrastination equation](https://alexvermeer.com/how-we-use-the-procrastination-equation/)-speak, this is reducing the impulsiveness by staying on target
    * "This is why Martin’s diligence is so important: Without this patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits, you’ll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital you need. I think the image of Martin returning to his banjo, day after day, for forty years, is poignant."


### All about control
* In keeping with the self-determination theory's "autonomy", Newport asserts that control over your working life is essential to a great job
    * But control is valuable you need to exchange career capital for it!
* Two traps you can fall into:
    * The **idealist's trap** (aka "first control trap"): pursuing lots of control without any career capital to buy it with = destitute and disillusioned
        * E.g. the people who start a blog without any plan or value hypothesis, convinced the money will come
    * The **coward's trap** (aka second control trap): you have enough career capital to pursue a greater bid for control, but your employer recognizes this and tries to keep you from pursuing it
        * Power, money, & prestige are tools employers use to keep you producing for them; they are NOT control!
        * Breaking free from this trap _does_ require courage (proper application of courage, in contrast to courage culture)
* "Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable." - Derek Sivers
    * If people don't want to pay for a thing, it's not valuable enough!
* Derek Sivers: **Only do what people are willing to pay you for**
    * This indicates that it's valuable (by definition, career capital-generating)

### All about missions
* Newport claims that a job-spanning "mission" is another way to find happiness and job satisfaction
* But, good missions are hard to find and require career capital
    * Missions have their own idealist's trap: a mission launched before you have enough career capital to understand the field is not relevant and will be discarded
* Instead, you need to build up enough career capital to get to the forefront of your field. From there, you can survey the **adjacent possible** - the space of visible-but-not-yet-accomplished things in your domain
    * In the same way that deliberate practice stretches you and inches your skills forward, well-chosen missions stretch the boundaries of human accomplishment
* Idea from "Where Good Ideas Come From": tech trees are real! For an idea/achievement to come into existence, it requires several other stepping stones to be reached
    * This explains the phenomenon of simultaneous independent invention - the radio, color photography, the isolation of oxygen, and natural selection were all accomplished by two unrelated people within a few years of each other
    * In Taleb-speak, the "random walk" element required for discoveries is actually brute-force combining existing ideas together until we hit on something new
* In order to actually target a good mission, you need to get to the cutting edge of your field
    * If you try to choose a mission before this point, you won't have enough knowledge to make novel discoveries - the combinations will have already been done before
    * This is why reading is powerful! It educates you on all the stuff that already exists, introducing new material into your proverbial chemical soup to expand the adjacent possible space so that your particular brain can make new connections
    * Reminds me of the [PhD School In Pictures article](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)
    * This is also why "follow your passion" without first having tons of career capital is bullshit! You won't actually be doing anything novel or meaningful
* A good mission accomplishes something novel and interesting (by definition, because it lies in the adjacent possible)

### Working towards a good mission
* You're not going to _know_ in advance that a mission is good
* Instead you'll need to iterate towards it - making little bets, observing the outcome, and renavigating
    * This is EXACTLY the reflect-synthesize-act/grind-renavigate cycle!
    * Bets should be bite-sized - a few months at most
    * Need to set [a Schelling fence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes) on bets in advance
        * This bounds the downside, and ensures you don't get caught on a slippery slope (e.g. "just a little more investment!" trying to make a doomed thing work)
    * Worst-case, your bet fails and you discovered what doesn't work
    * These little bets train the ability to bounce back from failure (i.e. [Taleb's antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility)), which is the most valuable skill you can have because it allows you to acquire all others
    * This dovetails with what Taleb says about optionality - take small, fixed-downside bets with unbounded upside! 
        * This is what happened for Steve Jobs: he tried this computer thing, and it paid off in a huge way
        * This is diversification! You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket with One Huge Time-consuming Project; instead have several irons in the fire to see which pays off
* Good missions are also marketable. They're:
    1. **Purple cows** - they turn heads; they're remarkable
        * The world is full of boring brown cows
        * Your projects should be easy to explain
    2. In a space where they can go viral; fertile for remarkability
        * Reduce the barrier for "infection" as much as possible!

### Cal's tips for putting it all together
* Don't fret about the "perfect" job; control & competence dictate happiness, not any particular instantiation of work
* On deliberately practicing & accumulating career capital:
    * Build [a Feynman Journal of "Things I Don't Know"](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/)
    * Time-bound your deliberate practice, e.g. "I am going to work until the nearest half-hour"
        * Remember that the mental discomfort usually fades within 5-10 minutes (this happens for me with drumming, reading, lifting, etc.) UNLESS I'm constantly distracted and resetting that timer (e.g. by checking Whatsapp, email, Slack, etc.)
    * (Personal, not from book) Chunk-bound your deliberate practice, e.g. "I'm not going to stop working until I finish the outline of this entire book summary"
    * Newport: "Strain, I now accepted, was good. Instead of seeing this discomfort as a sensation to avoid, I began to understand it the same way that a body builder understands muscle burn: a sign that you’re doing something right."
        * SURRENDER TO THE GRIND!
    * Build a weekly "research bible" by learning a piece of new & uncomfortable content and summarize it for understanding
    * Deliberate practice tally: keep a spreadsheet with a tally of how many hours you've spent each month in deliberate practice/deep work
    * Theory Notebook routine: when brainstorming new ideas, synthesize the final results of the brainstorming and put them on expensive paper, to make sure you're being very deliberate with what you record
* On avoiding the idealist's and coward's control traps: only do what people will pay you for
* On identifying a good mission, the three-level-pyramid approach:
    1. Top: current mission hypothesis (but subject to renavigation)
    3. Bottom: adding new material to the soup to potentially reveal a better mission
        * For Newport, this takes the form of reading a new paper every week, going on long walks to cogitate, and summarizing his learnings in his research bible. These server as fuel for the middle layer of the pyramid
    2. Middle: little bets (not more than a month) in service of this mission, WITH DEADLINES, to test viability of mission, produce something of value, and build career capital
        * Sounds like these ought to be SMART goals!
