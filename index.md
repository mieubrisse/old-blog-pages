Welcome to my blog! Here I aim to communicate what I've learned about living the good life in accessible prose with the intent of giving you a framework for improving your life. I've broken down the things often I think about into the "sequences" below, each designed to explain related concepts. If I've done my job well, you'll come out of each sequence with additional tools for understanding your world.

Efficiency Sequence
-------------------
In this sequence you'll learn all about exponential and linear trades, and the varying concepts that derive from them.

1. [The Power of Exponentiation](efficiency-sequence/power-of-exponentiation.md)
2. [Exponentiation Tradeoffs](efficiency-sequence/exponentiation-tradeoffs.md)
3. [Payout Frequency](efficiency-sequence/payout-frequency/payout-frequency.md)
