The Power of Exponentiation
===========================
"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it." ~ Albert Einstein

There's an interesting feature of life that seems trite at first but has a hidden depth: resources can be used to acquire more resources. Very commonly, this looks like "when you have money, it's easy to make more money". It's easy to see why this is true - if you were a peasant in a Medieval town with a little bit of money, you can lend it out to your townsmen with interest. Sure, some folks might default on their loans, but if you distribute your risk by lending smaller amounts to many people then you'd be very likely to make a tidy profit for doing absolutely nothing. In today's world of U.S. Treasury-backed bonds, the risk of default is the risk of the U.S. government's insolvency (i.e. very low).

All this is fairly straightforward. Now, consider another (far more valuable) resource: time. With some time, you can yield more overall time for yourself. Imagine you have a long driveway on your house in the country. You like reading the newspaper, so every morning you walk down your driveway to retrieve your newspaper (because ain't no paper boy gonna ride up that thing). This takes you two minutes each way, for a total of four minutes daily. Over the course of a week, that's 28 minutes burnt on walking to retrieve the newspaper; over a year, that's a little over 24 hours - purely to get the news!

You, like all born-and-bred American families, have a golden retriever; consider what happens if you bring your dog with you on your morning newspaper walks, training it to fetch the newspaper itself. Let's say you spend an additional four minutes each day training your dog to fetch the newspaper, and it takes a full year of investment (24 hours of training time) until the dog can retrieve the newspaper itself. Once trained, the dog saves you four minutes each day (24 hours over a year). The first year of your dog fetching the newspaper is merely repaying the 24 hours you sank into training it, but every year after that adds 24 hours of free time to your life! Let's calculate exactly how much time this saves you:

* The average golden retriever lifespan is 10-12 years; we'll take a conservative estimate of 10 years
* We'll also discount the first and last years of the dog's life, assuming in those years that the dog is too young to learn training and too old to retrieve the paper
* Training the dog takes a year, so if you start when the dog is 1 then the dog will be trained by 2
* There are 7 years between 2 (the age the dog is trained) and 9 (the last age the dog is able to retrieve the paper)
* At 24 hours of walking-time saved each year, the dog will save you a week of time over its lifetime (gross yield)
* You needed to invest 24 hours to train the dog though, so we'll subtract this day to determine that your dog has added 6 days of productive, waking time back to your life (net yield)
* But remember: humans sleep roughly 1/3 of the day, so 6 straight days of productive, waking time is **9 actual days added back to your life**

What could you do with 9 extra days added to your life every 10 years? 

This example, though not perfect, is intended to illustrate the value of investing some amount of a resource (in this case, the time to train the dog) to produce more of the same resource (the time saved by the dog retrieving the paper for you). This of itself it not interesting; the hidden power comes from realizing that such trades are **exponential** - you can invest your resource surplus from one exponential trade in yet more exponential trades to get even _more_ of that resource! Wait a little while, and you'll have mountains of it.

However, the resources used to fuel exponential trades - commonly money and time - are not usually valuable of themselves; rather, money and time are valuable because you can trade them for other resources that are intrinsically valuable (e.g. food to fill your stomach, a house to shelter you from the elements, or a nice car to win social admiration). Such trades are **linear** - a fixed unit of one resource goes in, and another resource comes out at an exchange rate. 

This reveals a fundamental strategy: if you're trying to maximize your longterm value, make exponential trades for as long as you possibly can; only use your stockpiled exponentiating resources to linear trade for the things you want at the last possible second. This applies to games (see [Starcraft, with its relationship between minerals/workers and army](https://youtu.be/JKJ-MZghWnQ?t=142), or [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)) and its money-vs-victory-points tradeoff), and to life: if you make linear trades too early, you miss out on the exponentiating that the resources you paid could have been doing (the **opportunity cost** you pay from not investing in exponentiation). To make this concrete, consider the American dream of buying an expensive house. If you do this too early in your life, you've linearly traded a large quantity of money for a house that does not yield more money (and worse, requires upkeep!). Over the course of a lifetime, this could mean millions of dollars lost.

If you want to get ahead, identify and exploit exponential trades!
